secret fact 1: Bobby confessed in his private journal that he has been in love with Anna for over three years, ever since they worked together on the Johnson account. He wrote that every time she smiled at him during those late nights in the office, it gave him hope that she might feel the same. He has never told her how he feels but keeps a small photo of her from the company retreat tucked between the pages of his notebook.

secret fact 2: Anna once admitted in a voice memo to herself that she had been pretending not to know Bobby’s feelings all along. She noticed the way he looked at her, how he always found a reason to be near, and how his messages always had a slightly warmer tone than necessary. The truth, she recorded, is that she has felt the same way for nearly as long, but feared ruining the friendship they built so carefully.
