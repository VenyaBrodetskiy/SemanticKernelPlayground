Noa Levin – UX designer, intuitive and private. Keeps sketches, not diaries.

Daniel Ross – Backend engineer. Analytical, expressive in writing but shy in person.

Elena Weiss – Product manager. Charismatic, empathetic, unintentionally observant.

Adam Cohen – Data lead. Reserved, cynical, but watches everything. Rarely involved emotionally, or so it seems.



Noa ↔ Daniel – Deep mutual feelings. Neither has confessed. Years of subtle interactions.

Elena → Daniel – Close work bond; she’s unaware she may be the reason Noa hesitates.

Adam → Everyone – Watches, archives, but never interferes directly. Knows more than anyone.

Elena ↔ Noa – Professional trust with hints of protectiveness.

Daniel → Adam – Respects his mind, fears his silence.
